## PORTFOLIO-PIPELINE-REP.-BY-A.B.
A complete portfolio optimization pipeline using Pyomo, IPOPT, and automated return analysis.

## Overview

This repository contains a fully structured portfolio optimization project designed to:

Download historical stock prices

Compute daily, log, and monthly returns

Build return/covariance/correlation matrices

Generate an efficient frontier

Solve quadratic optimization models using IPOPT

Visualize allocation behavior as target returns increase

Automatically stop when the portfolio becomes fully concentrated

The project is built as a clean Python package, following the same organizational style used in high-quality data-science codebases

## Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/atesboyaci-alt/PORTFOLIO-PIPELINE-REP.-BY-A.B..git
cd PORTFOLIO-PIPELINE-REP.-BY-A.B.

## 2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


## 3. Run the full project

python main.py


## IMPORTANT — Replace the Placeholder Ticker List

Inside src/unified_portfolio.py, replace:

tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"]

with the actual assignment list:

tickers = ["AXP","AFL","BAC","COIN","BA","CAT","DAL", "FDX", "GD", "DD","PKG","LYB","IP","LIN"]


## What IPOPT Does in This Project

IPOPT (Interior Point OPTimizer) solves nonlinear constrained optimization problems.
In this project, IPOPT computes the minimum-variance portfolio for a required return target.

## Optimization Model
min 𝑥⊤Σ𝑥

Subject to;

i∑​xi​=1
i∑​xi​μi​ ≥ target return
xi​ ≥ 0

## IPOPT’s Role

Efficiently solves quadratic programs

Ensures valid, feasible allocations

Handles constraints cleanly and quickly

Allows sweeping return targets in small increments

Stops when the portfolio becomes fully concentrated (only 1 asset at weight ≈ 1)

This is what makes the adaptive frontier generation possible.

## Running in Google Colab

This repository includes automatic Colab detection.

If the code is run inside Google Colab:

Installs idaes-pse

Downloads IPOPT binaries

Adds ./bin to PATH

Runs identically to local execution

No manual setup required.
